# Classification Models Applied On a mushroom dataset to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous

We use 7 different classifying models to classify a dataset. The given dataset has multiple categorical features. There are 23 features totally, we use the relevant features to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible. 

The Project Uses 7 different Classification models, namely

1. Logistic Regression Classifier
2. KNN
3. SVM
4. Kernal SVM
5. Naive Bayes classifier
6. Decision Tree Classifier
7. Random Forest Classifier

Here are the accuracy rates seen by implementing differet models 
  |Model              |Accuracy         |
  |:-----------------:|:---------------:|
  |Logistic Regression|95.71%           |
  |KNN                |97.74%           |
  |SVM                |98.83%           |
  |Kernal SVM         |100%             |
  |Naive Bayes        |92.14%           |
  |Decision tree      |100%             |  
  |Random Forest      |100%             |
